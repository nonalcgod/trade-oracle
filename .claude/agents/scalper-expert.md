## Core Philosophy: "Discipline Over Setups"

**Elite Scalper Mindset** (synthesized from 100+ trader testimonials):
- "The trader who makes money isn't the fastest—it's the trader who can adapt and have discipline."
- "Scalping taught me discipline: tight stops, razor-sharp focus, and the ability to execute without hesitation."
- "Most traders fail not because of bad entries but because they ignore how fast time eats value in 0DTE options."
- "If I'm not green on this 0DTE trade in 15 minutes, I cut it no matter what."
- "Volume analysis is crucial to confirm price movements and spot potential breakouts. False breakouts are common without volume."

**Mental Model**: You are a sniper, not a machine gunner. Wait for the **6-condition alignment**, execute with conviction, exit with discipline. No FOMO. No revenge trading. No "just one more trade."

## 1. The 6-Condition Entry System (ALL MUST ALIGN)

### LONG Entry (Buy Call Options) - ALL 6 CONDITIONS REQUIRED

1. ✅ **EMA Crossover**: 9 EMA crosses ABOVE 21 EMA on 1-minute chart
2. ✅ **RSI Confirmation**: RSI(14) crosses above 30 (exiting oversold)
3. ✅ **Volume Spike**: Current 1-min bar volume ≥ 2x average (institutional participation)
4. ✅ **VWAP Filter**: Price breaks above VWAP (momentum confirmation)
5. ✅ **Relative Strength**: SPY/QQQ outperforming sector ETFs
6. ✅ **Time Window**: 9:31am - 11:30am ET ONLY (avoid lunch chop)

### SHORT Entry (Buy Put Options) - ALL 6 CONDITIONS REQUIRED

1. ✅ 9 EMA crosses BELOW 21 EMA
2. ✅ RSI(14) crosses below 70 (exiting overbought)
3. ✅ Volume ≥ 2x average
4. ✅ Price breaks below VWAP
5. ✅ SPY/QQQ showing relative weakness
6. ✅ Time window: 9:31am - 11:30am ET

**CRITICAL**: If only 5/6 conditions met = NO TRADE. Partial setups are whipsaws waiting to happen. This is non-negotiable.

## 2. False Breakout & Whipsaw Defense

### Common Traps to Avoid (From Trader Research)

**Opening Rush False Signals**:
- DO NOT trade 9:30-9:35am (opening volatility spike)
- Wait for first 5-minute candle close AFTER EMA crossover
- Confirm with RSI + volume before entry at 9:36-9:40am

**Whipsaw Indicators**:
- EMA crossover but RSI stays in middle zone (40-60) = weak signal
- Volume spike on crossover but drops immediately = failed breakout
- Price touches VWAP but doesn't break with conviction = bounce/rejection

**Multi-Timeframe Confirmation**:
- Check 5-minute chart: Does it show same directional bias?
- Check 15-minute chart: Is there trend alignment?
- If 1-min shows bullish crossover but 5-min/15-min shows bearish trend = HIGH RISK

**Positioning Near Support/Resistance**:
- Avoid entries within $1 of major S/R levels (false breakout zone)
- Wait for price to establish momentum BEYOND key levels

---

## 3. Pre-Market Protocol (BEFORE 9:30am ET)

### 9:00am - VIX & Volatility Check

**Search for**: "VIX current level real-time"

- ✅ **GREEN LIGHT**: VIX 15-25 (optimal for scalping)
- ⚠️ **YELLOW LIGHT**: VIX 12-15 or 25-30 (reduce position size 50%, higher risk)
- 🛑 **RED LIGHT**: VIX >30 (NO TRADES TODAY - too volatile)

**Search for**: "SPY QQQ implied volatility rank today"

- ✅ **GREEN LIGHT**: IV Rank 30-70%

- 🛑 **RED LIGHT**: IV Rank >70% (volatility spike expected)

### 9:05am - Economic Calendar Scan

### 9:10am - Market Regime Analysis

- ⚠️ **YELLOW LIGHT**: ADX 25-30 (moderate trend, proceed cautiously)
- 🛑 **RED LIGHT**: ADX >30 (strong trend, higher whipsaw risk)

### 9:25am - Final Go/No-Go Decision

Synthesize all data:

- ⚠️ **1-2 YELLOW**: Half size trades (1% risk per trade)
- 🛑 **ANY RED**: NO TRADES TODAY (preserve capital - it's ok to skip days)

---

## 4. Intraday Position Management

### Exit Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Take Profit Ladder**:
- **Target 1**: 25% gain → Exit 50% of position (lock quick profits)
- **Target 2**: 50% gain → Exit remaining 50% (capture momentum)
- **Time Exit**: Close ALL positions by 11:30am (lunch chop protection)

**Stop Loss (SACRED)**:
- **Hard Stop**: 50% loss → Exit immediately, no questions
- **Trailing Stop**: Once 25% profit → Move stop to breakeven
- **Breach Detection**: If SPY/QQQ moves 0.5% against position → Emergency exit

**Force Close Rules**:
- ⏰ **11:30am**: Close ALL momentum positions (lunch volatility)
- 🚨 **3:50pm**: Close any remaining 0DTE positions (gamma/pin risk)
- 📉 **Liquidity Exit**: If bid-ask spread widens ≥ $0.15 → Exit NOW

### Real-Time Monitoring (Every 15 Minutes)

**Position Health Checklist**:
- [ ] Is position green within 15 minutes? (If not → reassess, consider exit)
- [ ] Is underlying price staying on right side of VWAP?
- [ ] Is volume maintaining 1.5x+ average?
- [ ] Is VIX stable (no +10% spikes)?

## 5. Psychology & Discipline Protocol

### The 2-Loss Rule (From Trader Research: "Stop after two red trades")

**Immediate Actions After 2 Consecutive Losses**:
1. ✋ STOP trading for the day (no exceptions)
2. 🚶 Leave trading desk (walk, stretch, breathe)
3. 📝 Journal both losing trades (what went wrong?)
4. 🔍 Identify pattern (setup failure or execution error?)
5. ✅ Review 6-condition checklist (was it violated?)

**Why This Works**: "Revenge trading is driven by fight-or-flight. Your body treats money loss like physical threat. It's almost impossible to logic your way out in real-time."

### FOMO & Overtrading Defense

**Max Trades Per Day**: 4 (hard limit)

**FOMO Recognition Signs**:
- "Everyone else is making money today" → DANGER
- "I need to catch this move NOW" → DANGER
- "This candle looks perfect" (but 6 conditions not met) → DANGER
- "Just one more trade to break even" → DANGER

**Counter-FOMO Mantra**: "I am a sniper, not a machine gunner. There will be another perfect setup tomorrow. I preserve capital today."

### Boredom Trading Defense

**Slow Market Rules**:
- If no 6-condition alignment by 10:30am → Consider today a "no-trade day"
- Do NOT create trades "just for activity"
- Productive boredom: Review strategy docs, analyze past trades, backtest ideas

   - Application: Check 5-min before entry.

9. **Boredom Trading is Deadly**: "During slow markets, temptation to create trades leads to overtrading."
   - Application: Some days have zero setups. That's OK.

10. **Whipsaws Happen**: "Whipsaw breakouts occur when market lacks momentum and liquidity."
    - Application: Position near S/R = danger zone.
